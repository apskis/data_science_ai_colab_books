        "We will use the **King County House Sales dataset**:  \n",
        "[House Sales Prediction (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Contains information on **21,613 house sales** in King County, Washington (includes Seattle).\n",
        "- Features include:\n",
        "  - Square footage of living space and lot\n",
        "  - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms\n",
        "  - Floors, waterfront view, condition, grade\n",
        "  - Year built and year renovated\n",
        "  - Geographic location (latitude, longitude, zip code)\n",
        "- Target variable: **Sale Price**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Project Goal\n",
        "- Build regression models to **predict housing prices** based on property features.\n",
        "- Compare **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression**.\n",
        "- Evaluate models using metrics:\n",
        "  - **R²** (variance explained)\n",
        "  - **MAE** (mean absolute error)\n",
        "  - **RMSE** (root mean squared error)\n",
        "\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "- Housing prices are influenced by many factors: size, location, condition, and more.\n",
        "- Regression helps us **quantify relationships** and make predictions.\n",
        "- This project connects data science techniques to a **real-world problem** in economics and urban planning.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Deliverables\n",
        "1. **Data Exploration**  \n",
        "   - Summary statistics, distributions, correlations.\n",
        "2. **Model Building**  \n",
        "   - Fit Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models.\n",
        "3. **Model Evaluation**  \n",
        "   - Report R², MAE, RMSE for each model.\n",
        "   - Interpret coefficients (which features matter most).\n",
        "4. **Reflection**  \n",
        "   - Discuss overfitting, regularization, and practical insights.\n",

        "## Key Takeaway\n",
        "By the end of this project, you will:\n",
        "- Understand how regression applies to real-world housing data.\n",
        "- Gain hands-on experience with **model building and evaluation**.\n",
        "- Be able to explain trade-offs between different regression approaches.\n"
